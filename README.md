# Intro-to-reinforcement-learning
This is a simple Q table based reinforcement learning algorithm aimed to help you get started. The task is for the agent cross a river represented by a string of dashes. I did not want to focus on the display of the environment much so it isnt a good interface

# Run
$ python3 qlearning1.py
